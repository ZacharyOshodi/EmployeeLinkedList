# MiniShowcase
For this mini-showcase I've outlined some code that I have worked on whether it be coursework or personal curiousity - 
I mainly seek to showcase some of my work.

While I do attend Texas State University I consider myself mainly self-taught so a lot of my work was done to suffice my own curiosity and pleasure.

In this repository I have mini-projects that I have worked on in C++/Java/MATLAB,etc.

I aspire to continuously add and grow my showcase repository as I grow my skillset.

In this README.md I will separate and categorize my work with explanations for each file

------------------------------- MATLAB - Stock Analysis ------------------------------------------------

In my MATLAB - Stock Analysis mini-project I analyzed 5 stocks against the S&P 500 and measured stats such as beta, standard deviation, covariance, etc.

There is an excel sheet as well that shows summary statistics as well as data visuals of the stocks comparative to one another.

---------------------------------- PizzaDeliverySystem----------------------------------------------------

This is a project we did in class where we utilized the common data structure of queues to imitate -
a pizza delivery system using java.

----------------------------------EmployeeManagementSystem - DoublyLinkedList-----------------------------

In this code I created a manual doubly linked list class in Java, (while the JDK does already provide a LinkedList
I decided to create my own). I essentially created a simple employee class with some attributes and methods and
then implemented them in a doubly linked list to keep them connected to one another.
